# What is Grasshopper?

Project created to be a crawl/walk/run approach to learning node js. The goal of the project is to take a project from
"Hello World!" all the way to a fully functional application.

Solid Interactive is going to document the phases of the project and tag our iterations so someone looking to see how
a full fledged application can come to life.

We are going to follow the below track to complete the project.
* Hello World
* UI Frameworks
* MVC
* Modularization
* Templating
* Documentation/Configuration
* Building
* Unit Testing
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Deployment
* Database Integration
* ORM

----------

More application specific requirements to follow.
